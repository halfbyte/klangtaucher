Rasterizer Source Distribution Readme

Rasterizer is (c) Jan Krutisch

To build the Rasterizer, put all jars in lib/ into the classpath.
You can get the source of the iText library @ http://www.lowagie.com/iText/

Currently there is no class documentation (as in "javadoc") available, 
sorry. This WILL change.

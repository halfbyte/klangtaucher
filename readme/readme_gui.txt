Rasterizer-GUI V0.1

This release sports a very simple gui that offers the same basic
functionality as the CLI version.

Just execute java -jar rasterizergui.jar and the gui pops up. The GUI itself
should be pretty self explanatory.

 Remark on Color support: Currently I'm using the rasterbator approach. The dots are printed with
  the corresponding rgb color, but the dot size is nevertheless calculated from the gray scale value
  which means that light colors will appear much lighter than they should, since both parameters (dot
  size AND dot brightness (expressed by the color) will vary. I will try to find an approach to 
  eliminate the brightness effect on the color (printing all dots in the same size will probably
  ruin the effect), but that won't be easy. Then again, this would really set me apart from the
  rasterbator for the first time... :)


This software is released under the GNU GPL. The Java source is contained in
the jar. Go for it.

Use at your own risk.

Have fun.

Jan

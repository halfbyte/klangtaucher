Rasterizer-GUI Readme (Windows exe version)

This release sports a very simple gui that offers the same basic
functionality as the CLI version.

Just execute rasterizergui.exe and the gui pops up. The GUI itself
should be pretty self explanatory.

This software is released under the GNU GPL. The Java source is contained in
the src folder. Go for it.

Use at your own risk.

Have fun.

Jan
